# facprecolorpicker - Founders & Coders Pre-Course Colour Palette Project
###### For one of my Pre-Course requirements, I built a simple colour palette project, in which the user can change the colour of an element - either a vertical or horizontal panel with one colour. This was based on a template provided of the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/daffed-9bf3f0-473198-4a0d67-adfc92), though other sites such as [Authentic](https://colours.neilorangepeel.com/) could equally apply. 
## Background context of colours
###### When constructing the JavaScript, I had to research briefly the complex reality behind colours, in particular the RGB colour model, in which the red, green, and blue primary colours of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colours. Understanding the RGB model was important, as it is the RGB model that is used for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers. I have also encountered issues with the RGB model when working on Photoshop. However, I have also used the Hexadecimal numbering system too as a backup, with base 16.

###### Colours can be represented in formats like RGB, Hexadecimal, or Hsl notation (the latter of which I haven't used). In order to generate a random colour, I used the Math.random() function, which generated a random number - which is essentially how colours are represented on a
